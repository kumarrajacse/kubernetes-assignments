Learning Objectives:-
Perform a rolling update of the container version
Roll back to the previous working state


Problem Statement:-
Your company's developers have just finished developing a new version of their candy-themed mobile game. They are ready to update the backend services that are running in your Kubernetes cluster. There is a deployment in the cluster managing the replicas for this application. The deployment is called candy-deployment. 

candy-deployment.yaml
--------------------------
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: candy-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: candy-ws
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: candy-ws
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: linuxacademycontent/candy-service:2
        name: candy-ws

ubuntu@ip-172-31-42-41:~$ kubectl apply -f candy-deployment.yaml
deployment.apps/candy-deployment created

ubuntu@ip-172-31-42-41:~$ kubectl get deployments
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
candy-deployment   2/2     2            2           44s


=================================================================================
You have been asked to update the image for the container named candy-ws in this deployment template to a new version, linuxacademycontent/candy-service:3.

ans:-

 ubuntu@ip-172-31-42-41:~$ kubectl set image deployment/candy-deployment candy-ws=linuxacademycontent/candy-service:3 --record=true
 deployment.apps/candy-deployment image updated

 
kubectl get deployment
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
candy-deployment   2/2     1            2           25m
==============================================================================

After you have updated the image using a rolling update, check on the status of the update to make sure it is working. If it is not working, perform a rollback to the previous state.

ubuntu@ip-172-31-42-41:~$ kubectl rollout history deployment/candy-deployment
deployment.apps/candy-deployment
REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
1         <none>
2         kubectl set image deployment/candy-deployment candy-ws=linuxacademycontent/candy-service:3 --record=true

ubuntu@ip-172-31-42-41:~$ kubectl rollout undo deployment/candy-deployment  --to-revision=1
deployment.apps/candy-deployment rolled back

=============================================================================================================
Make sure that the rolling update is in such a way that atleast 25% of pods are up and running during update with Zero downtime.



kubectl rollout status deployment/candy-deployment 
kubectl get rs
kubectl get pods
